0. Basic Flask app
First you will setup a basic Flask app in 0-app.py. Create a single / route and an index.html template that simply outputs “Welcome to Holberton” as page title (<title>) and “Hello world” as header (<h1>)
1. Basic Babel setup
Install the Babel Flask extension:

$ pip3 install flask_babel==2.0.0
Then instantiate the Babel object in your app. Store it in a module-level variable named babel.

In order to configure available languages in our app, you will create a Config class that has a LANGUAGES class attribute equal to ["en", "fr"].

Use Config to set Babel’s default locale ("en") and timezone ("UTC").

Use that class as config for your Flask app.

7. Infer appropriate time zone
Define a get_timezone function and use the babel.timezoneselector decorator.

The logic should be the same as get_locale:

Find timezone parameter in URL parameters
Find time zone from user settings
Default to UTC
Before returning a URL-provided or user time zone, you must validate that it is a valid time zone. To that, use pytz.timezone and catch the pytz.exceptions.UnknownTimeZoneError exception.
8. Display the current time
Based on the inferred time zone, display the current time on the home page in the default format. For example:

Jan 21, 2020, 5:55:39 AM or 21 janv. 2020 à 05:56:28

Use the following translations

msgid	English	French
current_time_is	"The current time is %(current_time)s."	"Nous sommes le %(current_time)s."
