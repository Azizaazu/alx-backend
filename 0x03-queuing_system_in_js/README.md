Using the Redis client again, set the value School for the key Holberton
127.0.0.1:[Port]> set Holberton School

127.0.0.1:[Port]> get Holberton
"School"

Install node_redis using npm

Using Babel and ES6, write a script named 0-redis_client.js. It should connect to the Redis server running on your machine:

It should log to the console the message Redis client connected to the server when the connection to Redis works correctly
It should log to the console the message Redis client not connected to the server: ERROR_MESSAGE when the connection to Redis does not work .
